# MAJOR PROJECT PROPOSAL FOR COMP SCI 30
### SHRAWAN PARMAR - CS30
## Description...

For my major project, I am planning to make a MARIO GAME. The reason why I chose to create a mario game is because, it allows me to show everything that I know and have learned in this course of computer science 30. This includes, OOP, LOOPS, ARRAYS, COLLISION DETECTION ETC...
Also It will be very challinging and intresting for me.

# MAJOR PROJECT PROPOSAL FOR COMP SCI 30
### SHRAWAN PARMAR - CS30
## Description...

For my major project, I am planning to make a MARIO GAME. The reason why I chose to create a mario game is because, it allows me to show everything that I know and have learned in this course of computer science 30. This includes, OOP, LOOPS, ARRAYS, COLLISION DETECTION ETC...Also It will be very challinging and intresting for me.

***I WILL BE DOING MY MAJOR PROJECT ON PROCESSING.*** The way I will start is by adding basic physics motion such as gravity and movements. I would create different classes of all the properties that I need for creating this game and get this game working with simple primitive shapes such as squares, rectangles, ellipse etc... I would add graphics and beauty to my game at the end. I would look some YouTube videos and tutorials to help create this game.

## TimeLine...
- start time - 14 April 2017 (Use my easter break to work on it)

It would take about 2-3 weeks to get basic game going. (JUST BASIC GAME MOVEMENTS AND INTERACTION WITHOUT ANY LEVELS OR GRAPHICS)
Finish Time of my Project - June 3rd 
During my progress, I would take different Pictures/Screen shots and also videos to document and to make my presentation.
I would try to be as clear, neat, and organized as possible.
I would start my Presentation as soon as I finish my Project and also I would try to it create during my Project work.
Finish Time of my Presentation â€“ June 8th
